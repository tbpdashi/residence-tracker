##ResidenceTracker

ResidenceTracker is a desktop app which can help landlords to manage multiple residences rented out on Airbnb. 
   
* It uses a **quick CLI** way to note down bookings and track status of different residence
(clean/occupied/needs cleaning...) , so the landlord can process booking in time and inform the cleaning agent as necessary.

* It is **written in OOP fashion**.
  
* This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
